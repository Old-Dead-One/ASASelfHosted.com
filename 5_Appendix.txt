Appendix D — Competitive Reference & Page Architecture Rationale

(BattleMetrics Structural Analysis)

Purpose

This appendix documents a structural analysis of BattleMetrics as a reference platform, identifying which pages and patterns are -functionally necessary-, which should be adapted, and which are intentionally excluded from ASA Self-Hosted.

This is not a feature comparison and not an endorsement.
It exists to validate architectural decisions, avoid unnecessary reinvention, and ensure long-term scalability without compromising the platform’s consent-first design.

D.1 Reference Platform Overview

BattleMetrics is a mature, widely used platform for game server discovery and analytics. Its success is not due to visual design or monetization tactics, but to a clear separation of concerns across three domains:

1. Public Discovery — Players finding servers
2. Operational Tooling — Server owners managing assets
3. Trust Signaling — Accuracy, history, verification, transparency

All major BattleMetrics pages map to one (and only one) of these domains.

ASA Self-Hosted adopts this structural clarity while diverging on data collection, consent, and monetization.

D.2 Account Model Validation

Single Account Type (Player + Server Owner)

BattleMetrics implicitly treats server owners as players by using a unified account system with contextual permissions.

ASA Self-Hosted explicitly adopts this model.

Design Decision (Locked):

- One account type
- No permanent role distinction
- Capabilities emerge from actions (claiming servers, generating keys, granting consent)

Rationale:

- Server owners are also players
- Players may later become owners
- Future player features require continuity
- Simplifies auth, RLS, and UI logic

This validates the decision to not create separate “Player” and “Owner” account systems.

D.3 Dashboard-Centric User Experience

BattleMetrics does not expose a public “Users” page.
Instead, all authenticated activity is anchored to a Dashboard.

ASA Self-Hosted Adoption

The Dashboard is the canonical post-login entry point.

/dashboard (Single Surface)

Initial sections:

- My Servers
- My Clusters
- Favorites
- Subscriptions
- Keys & Verification
- Consent & Permissions

Explicit Non-Goals:

- No split dashboards (player vs owner)
- No duplicate navigation trees

Outcome:

- Reduced UX fragmentation
- Clear mental model
- Future-proof for player stats and PvP integrations

D.4 Public Page Categories (Adopted)

D.4.1 Server Pages

BattleMetrics server pages establish the minimum viable expectations for:

- Status visibility
- Metadata
- Join paths
- Historical context

ASA Self-Hosted server pages meet and exceed this baseline by adding:

- Cryptographic identity
- Verified cluster membership
- Explicit consent boundaries

This page type is considered a pillar page and is mandatory.

D.4.2 Cluster Pages (Phase 1.5+)

BattleMetrics treats organizations as first-class entities.

ASA Self-Hosted mirrors this with Cluster Pages.

Planned capabilities:

- Member server aggregation
- Map coverage
- Cluster-level verification
- Aggregate uptime and stability indicators

Rationale:
Clusters are the true unit of loyalty and identity in Ark ecosystems.

D.4.3 Player Profile Pages (Consent-Bound)

BattleMetrics exposes detailed player histories by default.

ASA Self-Hosted intentionally diverges.

Player Profile Pages:

- Exist only with player opt-in
- Display favorites, badges, and optional activity indicators
- Never expose raw identifiers or hidden tracking

This preserves structural parity without violating consent principles.

D.5 Trust & Transparency Pages (Required by Launch)

BattleMetrics earns long-term trust by over-explaining its systems.

ASA Self-Hosted adopts this philosophy.

These pages are required by launch (not necessarily in the first MVP slice) and are part of the platform’s trust surface.

Required Pages:

Verification Explained

Explains:

- Manual vs Verified+
- What verification proves
- What it does not prove
- Why cryptographic keys exist
- Why rankings are data-driven, not monetized

Consent & Privacy by Design

Documents:

- Dual-consent model
- In-game authorization requirements
- Explicit non-capabilities
- Revocation behavior

These pages are defensive by design and considered part of the platform’s trust surface.

D.6 Pages Explicitly Not Adopted

The following BattleMetrics patterns are intentionally excluded:

❌ Live Player Tracking & Maps

- Violates consent-first principles
- Introduces unnecessary privacy risk
- Creates EOS adjacency concerns

❌ Paid Ranking Placement

- Conflicts with data-driven badge system
- Undermines platform neutrality
- Introduces long-term trust erosion

These exclusions are permanent unless explicitly re-approved by design review.

D.7 Canonical Page Map (Reference)

This page map reflects structural intent, not implementation order.

Home/directory (e.g. / or /directory) may include carousels (Newbie, Top 100, Hot) as content on the same route, not as separate routes.

/status (platform status or uptime page) is optional and may be post-MVP.

```
/
├─ directory
│  ├─ servers
│  ├─ clusters
│
├─ server/{id}
├─ cluster/{id}
├─ player/{handle}
│
├─ dashboard
│  ├─ servers
│  ├─ clusters
│  ├─ favorites
│  ├─ keys
│  ├─ consent
│
├─ verification
├─ consent
├─ docs
├─ about
├─ terms
├─ privacy
└─ status (optional)
```

D.8 Conclusion

This appendix confirms that ASA Self-Hosted’s current direction:

- Aligns with proven discovery platforms
- Improves upon them in consent enforcement
- Avoids common monetization and privacy pitfalls
- Scales cleanly into future player and PvP features

No architectural changes are required as a result of this analysis.
