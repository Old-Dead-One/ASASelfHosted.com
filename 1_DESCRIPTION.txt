ASASelfHosted.com - Description
ASASelfHosted.com is an independent, vendor-neutral registry for self-hosted Ark: Survival Ascended servers and clusters. 
It exists to solve a long-standing gap in the ASA ecosystem: reliable discovery, visibility, and trust for servers that are not hosted through Nitrado. The platform provides a free public directory where individual servers can be listed and maintained manually, alongside optional automation and verification for server owners who want deeper integration and transparency.
The project is built as a long-term, scalable platform rather than a short-lived listing site. It combines a modern web frontend with a Supabase-first backend for authentication, data integrity, and permissions, and a dedicated ASA Server API plugin that enables cryptographically verified server status, uptime tracking, and cluster identity. The result is a system that benefits players through accurate information and clear join paths, while giving server owners professional-grade tooling without forcing per-server hosting fees or pay-to-win placement.
ASASelfHosted.com is designed to grow into a broader ecosystem over time—including cluster health views, data-driven rankings, and future PvP/player integrations—while keeping the core directory free and accessible. It is, simply, the infrastructure self-hosted ASA servers should have had from the beginning.
